# Guide1
I wanted to make a live poster for my my cousins art show.
## Poster
### Body
Step 1: I began by adding a border around the boody to make a "poster"
Step 2: Insted of having a plain color background I added my cousins artwork from her art show to make it more personal.
Step 3: Next I wanted to be able to see the artwork and read the text at the same time so I made the box transparent.
Step 4: Made the Header animated. The color changes in 5 seconds and I chose colors that are in the background to tie them together.
### Footer
Step 5: Added a link to her website to read more about the artist. 
Step 6: Added features to the CSS to make the link not change color when viseted only then the mouse hovers over the link it changes to red.
